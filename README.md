# Start

To run the .jar file, please follow the list below:

1. Download the file.
2. Ensure that you have Java installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Java website if you haven't already.
3. Double click the File or open the command prompt by pressing the Windows key + R, typing "cmd" in the Run dialog, and pressing Enter.
4. In the command prompt, navigate to the directory where the .jar file is located using the "cd" command. For example, if the file is on your desktop, you can use the command cd Desktop to navigate to the desktop directory.
5. Once you are in the directory, run the .jar file by entering the command java -jar filename.jar in the command prompt, replacing "filename.jar" with the actual name of your .jar file.
6. Press Enter to execute the command, and the program should start running.

   
Please note that these instructions assume you have Java properly installed and configured on your Windows system. If you encounter any issues, make sure to check your Java installation and environment variables.
